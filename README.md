# Credit_Score-Prediction-Model
## Credit Score Prediction using Random Forest
This repository contains code and data for predicting credit scores using random forest algorithm. The code is implemented in Python using scikit-learn library.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Numpy
Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link.

[DATASET](https://statso.io/credit-score-classification-case-study/)

## Preprocessing
## The following preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset:

Remove irrelevant columns
Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
Impute missing values using the mean
Normalize the data

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier. The model was trained using the preprocessed data and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the credit score of an individual based on their financial data. The Random Forest Classification achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data, which is a good performance considering the complexity of the problem. The model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters or by using more advanced machine learning algorithms.
